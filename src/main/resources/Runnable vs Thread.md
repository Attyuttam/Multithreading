### Implementing Runnable vs Extending Thread class

* Which approach is better ?
  * If we extend Thread then we cannot extend any other class, usually a big disadvantage
  * However, a class may implement more than one interface, so while using Implements Runnable approach there is not restriction to extension of class now or in the future
