Introduction
-
Semaphore is a synchronization mechanism used to control access
to a shared resource in concurrent programming. it uses counters
to manage the number of allowed accesses to the resources thereby 
preventing race conditions and ensuring safe concurrent operations.


Semaphores can be binary or counting depending on the number of
accesses permitted.
